# davinci_nlp
A collection of NLP task projects.
Ranging from implementation of Deep Learning model, transformer-based model, and other state-of-the-art model or algorithms in NLP.


# Project 1 - Sentiment Analysis
The Sentiment Analysis project aims to develop an intelligent system based on AI technology to classify sentiments on Twitter using the text analysis method. This system will help obtain positive, negative or neutral opinion sentiment trends from users on the platform.

The dataset used is a collection of tweets from Twitter users during the 2019 Presidential Election. The dataset was obtained through a web scraping process. The data consists of 1815 tweets that contain three categories of sentiment: positive, neutral and negative.

# Project 3 - Automatic Speech Recognition
Develop AI models for Automatic Speech Recognition task by fine-tuning pre-trained models such as WAV2VEC2, Whisper, and HuBERT.

The project uses MINDS-14 dataset which popular in domain research. Specifically uses the en-US language version.
